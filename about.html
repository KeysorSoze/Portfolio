        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Web design is beauty in simplicity. The web empowers anyone to have a voice, an audience, and online persona. People love to feel informed and in control and the web allows you to use the power of self service to provide a white glove service
            to any audience you have. People choose to leverage power of the web to reach not only a larger audience but also a new way of life. A quality website is priceless for any business. Allowing you to provide a way for customers to resolve their
            own concerns without needing a real person to interact with. You can do anything from creating leads to selling products directly. </p>
        <p>There is a moment in when all the hard work comes together after working on a project with a team for weeks if not months. A moment where my heart skips in anticipation of all our hard work is about to be put to the test. The feeling in the room
            of everyone holding their breath for a few short moments. The electricity in the air. There is no feeling like success with a team.</p>
        <p>I am a maker at heart. I love building new items and experiences. I am a 3d printer enthusiast and use to help large companies maintain their devices. Also, I am lucky enough to live right on the foot hills. I take advantage of this by paddle
            boarding, hiking, rock climbing, and golfing when ever the weather permits. I am an enthusiast of games. I love playing video games when I am not able to do outdoor activities and above all enjoy a quality game of chess.</p>
