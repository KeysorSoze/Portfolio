            <h3>Use Case</h3>
            <p>Use Case is a website designed to help with web development. Examples of syntax and available tools will be listed in a fashion that is both easy to find and useful. I believe that being concise is more important than a large volume of content.
                My target is web designers. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

            <h3>Open Anxiety Tracker</h3>
            <p> Anxiety trackers are a therapist-recommended tool that can help people with mental health problems identify root causes of their issues. Finding a root cause of anxiety is the first step to healing. I find it immoral that anxiety tracker applications
                cost money for all the features. People should not feel like they must be nickel dimed because they want to be the best version of themself. This leads me to create my website with an anxiety tracker and other self-help tools. My target
                is anyone interested in self-help but cannot afford traditional methods. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
