            <h3>Use Case</h3>
            <p>Use Case is a website designed to help with web development. Examples of syntax and available tools will be listed in a fashion that is both easy to find and useful. I believe that being concise is more important than a large volume of content.
                This project will use the lamp stack to be hosted.</p>

            <h3>Open Anxiety Tracker</h3>
            <p> Anxiety trackers are a therapist recommended tool that can help people with mental health problems identify root causes of your issues. Finding a root cause to anxiety is the first step to healing. I find it immoral that anxiety tracker applications
                cost money for all the features. People should not feel like they must be nickel dimed because they want to be the best version of them self. This lead me to creating my own website with an anxiety tracker and other self help tools.</p>
